# feature_decorrelation_and_selection_to_explainable_predictions

Made to deal with hundreds of highly intercorrelated features, by forcefully decorrelating them against each other and selecting the strongest ones until only the strongest few percent of the original amount are left. Finally a very simplified as grid search is done and the algorithm is interrogated by Skater to create the visual relationships between the features and the target. (Visualised in another visualization tool) (visualization are partially censored to avoid naming key drivers)
